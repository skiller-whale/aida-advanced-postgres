|    2. Window Functions (OVER and PARTITION BY)
|
|    Use a window function to write a query that will return:
|    (one row for each row in the scores table):
|
|    * The student's name.
|    * The subject from the scores table (there are multiple for each student)
|    * The score from the scores table
|    * The average score for each student across all of their subjects
|

-- TODO: Write your query here (remember to end it with a semicolon ;)
--       (You can copy any joins from the query above to save time!)
