|    5. Using row_number() and ORDER BY
|
|    Use a window function to write a query that will return:
|    * Each student's name.
|    * Their alphabetical position in the set of all students
|       (the alphabetically first name should have the value 1)
|
|    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
|
|    Now add two new columns to the query:
|    * The tutor's name for the student as `tutor_name`.
|    * The students alphabetical position amongst students with the same tutor, as `position_for_tutor`.
|
|    If you order the query by `tutor_name` and `position_for_tutor` then you
|    should be able to check that the values look sensible.
