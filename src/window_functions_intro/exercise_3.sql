|    3. Window Functions with Filters
|
|    Use a window function to write a query that will return:
|
|    * Each student's name
|    * The 'maths' score for the student
|    * The tutor name for the student
|    * The average 'maths' score for students with the same tutor
|
|    Note: There is a uniqueness constraint on the database, so a student can
|          only ever have one score for each subject.
|
|    * OPTIONAL EXTRA: Add a column that contains the difference between the
|                      students maths score and the average for their tutor.
